Pulumi is an open source cloud development tool. It can be used to develope and configure resources on any cloud by coding infrastructure with choice of multiple languages like Python 3, Node.js - Javascript and Typescript, Go etc.
Pulumi is multi-cloud as well as it is supported on AWS, Azure and GCP clouds along with Kubernetes for any public, private or hybrid cloud. <br />

Pulumi has a cloud object model along with its evalution runtime that automatically understands the program written in any language. It knows what cloud resources are required to execute the programs and then manages them in a robust way. Pulumi's cloud runtime and its object model are language-neutral as well as cloud-neutral, hence making it possible to support so many languages and cloud out of the box. <br/>

Pulumi's use of general purpose languages for code, allows us to use the concepts of abstraction, modularity (reuse by help of methods and classes), inheritance, libraries, toolability (access to IDEs, refactoring, static analysis etc.) , testing etc.
